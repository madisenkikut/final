		<p>Rosalind Franklin was very intelligent from a young age and knew 
		that she wanted to be a scientist since age 15. She went to Newnham College
		and studied chemistry. She was accepted as a bachelor's degree for employment. 
		She then went on to work as an assistant research officer at the British Coal
		Utilisation Research Association. She studied the porosity of coal, which 
		was the basis of her 1945 Ph.D thesis "The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids
		with special reference to coal." Franklin was appointed at the Laboratoire 
		Central des Services Chimiques de I'Etat in Paris in 1946. While there, Jacques
		Mering taught her X-ray diffraction, which led to the discovery of the "secret of 
		life."</p>

        <h1>Photographing the Double Helix</h1>
        	<p>Rosalind Franklin photographed an image of the double helix
        	of DNA, which was one of the most significant scientific discoveries
        	ever. Because of her, we now know that DNA has the structure of a double 
        	helix</p>
